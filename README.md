index.js provides the code to print all even and odd numbers in an array.
if input is = [
    3, 7, 2, 15, 9, 20, 5, 14, 12, 1, 8, 11, 6, 19, 4, 10, 17, 13, 16, 18,
  ];

  output is = [
    3, 7, 2, 15, 9, 20, 5, 14, 12, 1, 8, 11, 6, 19, 4, 10, 17, 13, 16, 18,
  ];

app.js provides many functions.
* if given an array it can find all the prime numbers and push all them into another array .
* it then finds the max value and min value elements from the prime number array.
* it also provides us with the sum of the prime numbers.

if input array is [
    19, 23, 4, 16, 28, 13, 31, 8, 29, 14, 6, 35, 2, 11, 17, 5, 9, 27, 12, 30,
  ];

  expected output is [
  19, 23, 13, 31, 29,
   2, 11, 17,  5
]

min value = 2
max value = 31
sum of prime = 150
